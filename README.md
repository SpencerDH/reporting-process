These files are available to help reproduce the results for the
manuscript "Anticipating epidemic transitions with imperfect data."
The directories tobyfigs and eric-figs contain the files needed to
produce the figures from simulation results. The directories that
begin with simulation provide the files needed to reproduce the
simulation results. The simulation directories all have a similar
structure, and can produce simulation results with different
parameters. Further details may be found in the README.md in those
directories.
