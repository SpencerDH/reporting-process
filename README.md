These files contain the code necessary to reproduce the results shown in the paper "Anticipating epidemic transitions with imperfect data." The directories that begin with simulation provide the files needed to reproduce the simulation results. The directories tobyfigs and eric-figs contain the files needed to produce the figures from simulation results. 

The simulation directories all have a similar structure, and can produce simulation results with different
parameters. Further details may be found in the README.md in those directories.
